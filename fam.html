                I book myself tables<br>
At all the best restaurants, then eat alone<br>
I buy myself fast cars<br>
Just so I can drive them real fuckin' slow<br>
I like my own company<br>
Company, I don't need it<br>
I'm not always cold<br>
I'm just good on my own, so good on my own<br>

                Oh brother, we'll go deeper than the ink<br>
Beneath the skin of our tattoos<br>
Though we don't share the same blood<br>
You're my brother and I love you that's the truth<br>

                You taught me everything<br>
And everything you've given me<br>
I'll always keep it inside<br>
You're the driving force in my life, yeah<br>
There isn't anything<br>
Or anyone that I could be<br>
And it just wouldn't feel right<br>
If I didn't have you by my side<br>

                The older I get the more I can see<br>
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me<br>
And he did the best that he could<br>
And I only hope when I have my own family<br>
That every day I see a little more of my father in me, yeah<br>
